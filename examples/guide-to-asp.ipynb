    "## Answer set semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer set programming is based on the *answer set semantics* for logic programs. This is easiest explained if we start looking at propositional logic programs. Such a program consists of several rules of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a :- b_1, ..., b_n, not c_1, ..., not c_m.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where each of $a$, $b_i$ and $c_i$ are propositional atoms (that start with a lowercase letter). In such a rule, `a` is called the *head* and `b_1, ..., not c_m` is called the *body*. The order of elements within the body of the rule does not matter. This rule is roughly interpreted as: \"$a$ is true if $b_1$, ..., $b_n$ are true, and $c_1$, ..., $c_m$ are not true.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also free to choose $n=0$, $m=0$, or both. In case both $n=0$ and $m=0$, the rule is simply written as `a.` (and the rule is interpreted as \"$a$ is true\"). So the following are valid rules in a logic program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a.\n",
    "a :- b_1, ..., b_n.\n",
    "a :- not c_1, ..., not c_m.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An *interpretation* for a logic program is typically taken to be a set $I$ of propositional atoms. All atoms in the set $I$ are true in this interpretation, and all atoms that are not in $I$ are false in the interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models for positive programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer sets are a particular type of models for logic programs. To explain the particular property that answer sets should have, we first have a look at models for positive programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *positive program* is a logic program that does not contain negations (`not`). In other words, it is a set of rules that are all either of the form `a.` (interpreted as: \"$a$ is true\") or of the form `a :- b_1, ..., b_n.` (interpreted as \"if $b_1$, ..., $b_n$ are true, then $a$ should also be true\"). So, a positive program can be seen as a set of facts (`a.`) and logical implications ($(b_1 \\wedge \\dotsm \\wedge b_n) \\rightarrow a)$, written as `a :- b_1, ..., b_n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A *model* for a positive program is an interpretation $I$ that makes all the logical statements encoded by the rules in the program true. However, some of these models make more sense than others. For example, for the program `a. b :- a.`, the interpretation $I = \\{a,b\\}$ is a model, but so is $I = \\{a,b,c\\}$. The first of these two looks reasonable, but the second not so much. For example, to make the rules in the program true, we need to include $a$ and $b$ in the interpretation, but what justification do we have for putting $c$ in?\n",
    "\n",
    "For positive programs, we are interested in *minimal models*: models $M$ such that no (strict) subset $M' \\subseteq M$ also makes the program true. For a positive program $P$, we define the *answer sets* of $P$ to be the set of all minimal models of $P$. It turns out that if a positive program $P$ has a model, then there is always a single unique minimal model of $P$.\n",

    "Taking the unique minimal model of a positive program nicely matches with our intuition of what we want from models. We include all atoms that are declared to be true in the program (in our example: $a$ and $c$). Then we add other atoms that we must include to make all if-then rules true (for example, adding $b_2$ because we already included $c$ and because `b_2 :- c` is in the program), until we are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we don't include $d$ and $e$, because there is no reason to add them to the model. (We could have added both to the model, and still satisfy all if-then rules.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programs with negation\n",
    "\n",
    "For logic programs where some rules contain a negation (`not`), things don't turn out to be as easy as simply iterating all if-then rules until we reach a fixpoint. For example, look at the following program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "a.\n",
    "c :- a, not b.\n",
    "d :- c.\n",
    "b :- d.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we would use the strategy of applying if-then rules as long as we can, we would first add $a$, then $c$ (due to the rule `c :- a, not b.`), then $d$ (`d :- c.`), and $b$ (`b :- d.`). But then by adding $b$, we made the application of the rule `c :- a, not b.` invalid (because it only works to justify adding $c$ if $b$ is not true).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we want to select from all the models of a program with negation those models that we are interested in (the answer sets). The idea is to guess an interpretation $I$, use this interpretation to make a version $P^I$ of the program $P$ without negation ($P^I$ is called the *reduct* of $P$ w.r.t. $I$), and then check that $I$ is the unique minimal model of $P^I$â€”if this is the case, then $I$ is an *answer set* of $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works with a simple example. Take the following program $P$ (lines starting with `%` are comments):\n",
    "```\n",
    "% the program P\n",
    "c.\n",
    "d :- c, not b.\n",
    "b :- not d.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Take also the interpretation $I_1 = \\{c,d\\}$. The new program $P^{I_1}$ we get from $P$ by:\n",
    "1. Removing all rules containing some `not a` in the body such that $a \\in I_1$. So in our example, we remove `b :- not d.`, because $d \\in I_1$.\n",
    "1. Removing all remaining statements `not a` from the rest of the program. For all of these statements it holds that $a \\not\\in I_1$, otherwise we would have removed the entire rule containing the `not a` in step (1). So in our example, we change `d :- c, not b.` into `d :- c.`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in our example, the program $P^{I_1}$ becomes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% the reduct P^{I_1}\n",
    "c.\n",
    "d :- c.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have that $I_1 = \\{c,d\\}$ is the unique minimal model of $P^{I_1}$, so $I_1$ is an answer set of $P$.\n",

You may also use `#maximize` statements with tuples of different arity (e.g., triples, or 1-tuples).

We consider rules `a ; b :- c_1, ..., c_n` as the logical implication $(c_1 \\wedge \\dotsm \\wedge c_n) \\rightarrow (a \\vee b)$. That is, we interpret disjunction in the head as logical disjunction in the consequent of the implication. Using this, we can use a similar definition of what an answer set is: an interpretation $I$ that is a minimal (w.r.t. set inclusion) model of the reduct $P^I$ of the program $P$ w.r.t. $I$.\n",

This is also the case if we remove $a$ and $b$ from $I_1$. If we instead only remove $b$ from $I_1$, we get the interpretation $\\{a\\}$, which does not satisfy `b ; c :- a.`. Thus, $I_1$ is a minimal model of $P^{I_1}$.\n",
